He is working at Putzmeister Holding GmbH since 2019 in the Strategic Purchasing department as a Project Purchasing Manager which gives him a great overview of almost every category in industrial manufacturing and therefore an extensive knowledge of applied economics and the current states of the global economy itself.

The focus was mainly on the electronics industry and related to industrial ethernet products. 

 

Tobias did some additional studies of audio engineering without a degree to expand his knowledge in this field to support his activities as a musician.
