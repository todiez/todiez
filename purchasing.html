          In his role as Project Purchasing Manager at Putzmeister, Tobias is
          responsible for the strategic procurement of various projects. This
          includes ensuring the best possible material prices, monitoring lead
          times and coordinating all newly developed parts with the global
          strategic purchasing department.
          <br />
          He thus works at the interface between the highly qualified engineers
          of Putzmeister Engineering GmbH and the global category managers of
          Putzmeister Holding GmbH as well as the local buyers of Putzmeister
          global subsidiaries (e.g. Turkey, India, USA, China, Mexico),
          depending on the regional project scope respectively depending on the
          available partners and suppliers.

      <div>
        <p>
          A general global trend in the construction machinery industry is the
          electrification of existing machines and the development of completely
          new innovations. Putzmeister, as a global leader in the industry, is
          setting standards here. Tobias is very proud to be part of these
          innovative projects and loves to lead them to success.
          <br />
          As a result of these activities, he has a comprehensive overview of
          the supply chain and the market for batteries and electric motors,
          which is a market that will develop tremendously in the coming years.
          The goal is to reduce CO2 emissions to almost zero (depending on
          whether green electricity is available or not), as well as a
          significant reduction in noise from construction machinery.

        <p>
          The new Putzmeister eMixer - tour by tour - efficient, emission-free
          and 100 % electric.
          <br />
          <br />
          As a construction equipment manufacturer, we are aware that the
          construction industry is responsible for almost 40 % of CO² emissions
          worldwide. That is why we at Putzmeister place the topic of
          sustainability at the center of our innovation strategy.
          <br /><br />
          With the iONTRON eMixer from Putzmeister, you are the highlight on
          every construction site. Whether it's an inner-city family home or an
          infra-structure project in the big city - with the eMixer, you can
          drive through your area of operation without any restrictions.

        <p>
          Worldwide Novelty – First Emission-free Truck-Mounted Concrete Pump
          <br />
          <br />
          The iONTRON Hybrid is a worldwide novelty due to new integrated
          solution into the hydraulic pumps line, which saves space and weight -
          Putzmeister patent is pending.
          <br /><br />
          The e-engine is supplied by the jobsite electricity and no additional
          battery is needed, which results in more payload reserves for the
          daily operation of the concrete pump.
          <br />
          <br />Pumping concrete electrically has never been so easy – just
          “Plug and Pump”.

          At Hirschmann, which is part of Belden, Inc., Tobias held two roles
          simultaneously: Global Category Manager and Project Buyer. As Category
          Manager, he was responsible for strategic series procurement of
          various electronics categories including active and passive components
          such as switching asics, SFPs, phys, connectors and power supplies, as
          well as commodities, software and licenses. Responsibilities included
          annual price and contract negotiations, supplier selection, and
          planning and implementation of product specific sourcing strategies.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          In his second role as project buyer, Tobias was at the forefront of
          industrial ethernet technology development and in constant
          communication with suppliers to create the best possible solutions.
          The goal was to implement the latest available technologies from
          suppliers into Hirschmann's products, as well as helping to steer the
          development at the suppliers. This role included tasks such as
          strategic price and framework contract negotiations, bid evaluations
          for all newly required parts of the products and the definition of
          appropriate sourcing strategies. He was also responsible for meeting
          deadlines and tracking first article deliveries in an agile
          development environment.
